@QCIIntroLecture
a) timeline
a1) feynman gave a talk that said that regular computers cant simulate quantum mechanics
a2) deutsch-Josza algorithm said that there are things that you cant do on a regular algo
a3) shores solves large umbers problem
a3a) can factor in a reasonable amount of time
a4) IBM was making qbits
a5) after that work was just making a system
a6) reggeti qci startup
a7) ibm vs google arms race to the first one
a8) regetti allows you to build and test with quantum stuff
a9) google claims that theyre going to have a 49 qbit machine
b) there arent enough resources for people who want to build with quantum computers
b1) thats the goal of this program
